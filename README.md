# Adventure Girl Run 🎮  

This is my very first coding project, a simple 2D game built with JavaScript back in 2022. It's a basic runner-style game where a character runs, and the player interacts to keep the game going.  

## 🎯 About the Game  
- A 2D endless runner featuring "Adventure Girl."  
- Simple animations and character movements.  
- Keeps track of the player's score.  
- Displays a "Game Over" screen when the game ends.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- JavaScript  
- HTML5  
- CSS  

## 🚀 How to Play  
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
2. The game starts with an idle animation.  
3. Use the keyboard controls (space btn) to play.  
4. Avoid obstacles and try to achieve a high score.  
5. If the game ends, click "Try Again" to restart.  

## 🔥 What I Learned  
- Implementing animations in JavaScript.  
- Handling user input events (space btn click).  
- Basic game mechanics and score tracking.  
- Working with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript together.  

## 📌 Future Improvements  
Since this was my first project, it's quite simple. But I might improve it later by adding:  
- More obstacles and challenges.  
- Background music and sound effects.  
- Character selection and enhanced animations.  

Feel free to check it out and suggest improvements! 😊
